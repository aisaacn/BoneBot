# BoneBot
### ECE434 Final Project
Dalton Stichtenoth and Isaac Austin

Our project, the **BoneBot**, uses the following hardware:
 - (1x) Mechatronics chassis with (2x) DC motors w/ wheels (courtesy of Dr. Fisher)
 - (1x) BeagleBone Black
 - (1x) USB WiFi dongle (courtesy of Dr. Yoder)
 - (1x) Breadboard
 - (1x) L293D H-Bridge
 - (2x) Keyes IR sensors
 - (1x) 5V / 1A battery pack
 - Many wires
 
The software is largely accomplished using the [JavaScript Blynk](https://blynk.io/en/getting-started) library, which allows control of GPIO pins from a smart device.
